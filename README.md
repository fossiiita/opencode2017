# Contributing

## Code practices

Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor.
We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

- [People before code](http://hintjens.com/blog:95): If any of the following rules are violated, the pull-requests must not be rejected. This is to create an easy and joyful onboarding process for new programmers and first-time contributors.

- Single commit per pull request and name the commit as something meaningful, example: `Adding <-your-name-> in students/mentors section`.

- Reference the issue numbers in the commit message if it resolves an open issue. Follow the pattern `Fixes #<issue number> <commit message>`

- Provide the link to live `gh-pages` from your forked repository or relevant screenshot for easier review.

- Pull Request older than 4 days with no response from the contributor shall be marked closed.

- Avoid duplicate PRs, if need be comment on the older PR with the PR number of the follow-up (new PR) and close the obsolete PR yourself.

Also, we have a team of maintainers to whom you can write if your pull-request goes unnoticed. They may have time.

## After each contribution

After your awesome contribution, add your contribution details to [scores.yml](https://github.com/fossiiita/opencodecollab/blob/master/_data/scores.yml). Please maintain the following format EXACTLY (replacing values where indicated):

```
- github: your_username
  contributions:
    - name: short_title_for_contribution
      link: url_to_contribution_as_proof
      score: 10
    - name: other_contribution_if_any
      link: url_to_other_contribution_as_proof
      score: 20
  total: 30
```

**IMPORTANT:**

-  If you don't have a record in ```scores.yml``` you can create yours at the bottom or in any order. You can refer to [this](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html) if you want help with YAML syntax, but if you follow the above format strictly you wont be needing it!

- For your future contributions, please create a short PR to update your contributions and total score in ```scores.yml```. This helps us to track your contributions effectively.

##Installation

## Prerequisites
### Mac OSX/Linux
OpenCode is built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which comes as a ruby gem. So you need to install Ruby to get started.

[RVM](https://rvm.io/) make it easy to install and manage different versions of Ruby. Install Ruby using RVM by running the following commands

```
~ $ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3

~ $ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

This installs RVM with the latest stable version of Ruby

**Ubuntu users:** You may need to enable `Run command as a login shell` in Ubuntu's Terminal, under _Edit > Profile Preferences > Title and Command_. Then close the terminal and reopen it. You may also want to run `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm` to load RVM.

To install ruby gems from a Gemfile you would need `bundler` which by default comes with RVM ruby but if isn't present you would need to install it using the command `gem install bundler`.

### Windows

If on Windows, you can follow [this guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/) on how to install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Deployment
After you have installed Ruby and cloned the repository deploy the application running the following commands
```
# Enter the app directory


# Install gems using bundler
~$ bundle install

# Build site starting jekyll server
~$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You are ready to go! Browse to `http://localhost:4000`
